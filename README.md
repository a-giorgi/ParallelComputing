# Mid Term

For the Mid Term assignment we've made a Multithread Image Loader in Java
This soffware is made in Java and to be executed it requires the Java Runtime Environment ([https://www.java.com/it/download/](https://www.java.com/it/download/)) to be installed.
It is developed with IntelliJ Idea Community ([https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/))

The main purpose of this sofware is to compare performances between sequentially and parallel image loading.
Detailed information about performances and development will be descripted inside the assignent paper (it has still to be written)

# Final Term
For the Final Term assignment we've made a DES Password Decryption (still in development)
