# Mid Term

For the Mid Term assignment we've made a Multithread Image Loader in Java
This soffware is made in Java and to be executed it requires the Java Runtime Environment ([https://www.java.com/it/download/](https://www.java.com/it/download/)) to be installed.
It is developed with IntelliJ Idea Community ([https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/))

The main purpose of this sofware is to compare performances between sequentially and parallel image loading.
Detailed information about performances and development are described inside the assignent paper (Multithread Image Reader with Java Threads.pdf)

# Final Term
For the Final Term assignment, we've made a DES Password Decryption software with a sequential implementation in C++ and two parallel variants: one made with OpenMP and the other with CUDA.

The main purpose of this software is to compare the performances between the sequentially and CPU/GPU parallel DES Password Decryption using a brute force approach. Detailed information about performances and development can be found inside the assignment paper (Des Password Decryption.pdf)
